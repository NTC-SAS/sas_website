                                    The National Teachers College was founded by Dr. Segundo M. Infantado, Sr. and Dr. Flora Amoranto-Ylagan. It
                                    was officially incorporated on September 29, 1928 in accordance with Republic Act No. 1459 as amended and
                                    was authorized by the Department of Public Instruction to operate as an educational institution on April 17,
                                    1929. Its doors opened to the student public on June 10, 1929 and it was granted government recognition on
                                    February 17, 1930. On its first year of operations, it was permitted by the government to operate a complete
                                    General Course in Education leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Education, a complete Preparatory
                                    Course leading to the title of Associate in Arts, and complete courses in General High School, Commercial High
                                    School and High School in Home Economics---the first of its kind in the Philippines.
                                    The College started with seventy-six students and sixteen faculty members. Classes were held in a two-storey
                                    nine-room building on the corner of Mendiola and Legarda Streets in Manila. Dr. Jose P. Laurel, who later

                                    became the president of the Republic of the Philippines, served as the first Chancellor of NTC. He served the
                                    NTC community from 1928 to 1953.
                                    Among the pioneer members of the faculty were distinguished professionals of established reputation, led by
                                    the founders, Dr. Segundo M. Infantado Sr. and Dr. Flora A. Ylagan. The powerhouse roster of faculty helped to

                                    attract more enrollees. Student population rose in its second year of operation despite the disastrous world-
                                    wide economic depression in 1929.

                                    <br />
                                    In response to the increase in enrollment, NTC occupied its second site in Lepanto corner Paredes Streets in
                                    Manila. At this point, NTC holds the distinction of being the first to be authorized to offer General Secondary
                                    classes for teachers during the long vacation of 1930.
                                    Master of Arts in Education (MAEd) was first offered in 1931 and gained government recognition in 1941.
                                    Further expansion was seen in 1932 when NTC moved to Azcarraga, known today as Claro M. Recto Avenue. The
                                    site was occupied by the institution from 1932 to 1939.

                                    SERVING THE NATION THROUGH EDUCATION
                                    The Second World War interrupted the expansion program of the College and destroyed much of the
                                    improvements it took years to build. The occupying Japanese Armed Forces purged the library of all books
                                    which dealt with western culture, especially those which are American in nature, as well as the collection of
                                    specimens which greatly reduced the laboratory facilities.
                                    Liberation in 1945 brought about reorganization and renewed dedication of the College to the cause of
                                    teacher education. The campus was relocated to Tanduay Street, known today as Nepomuceno Street, in
                                    Quiapo Manila. When classes resumed at the opening of the school year in 1945, only a third of the pre-war
                                    students were able to return. Yet the College served more than double the old enrolment because its
                                    facilities were used in the evening without remuneration by the United States Armed Forces for educational
                                    purposes.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    EXPANSION, GROWTH, AND CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT
                                    The College moved several steps forward by including new courses from the Kindergarten to the
                                    Doctoral levels. NTC was the first to offer a three-unit course in Contemporary Philippine Literature in
                                    English. It was a required course for BSE and AB students majoring in English in 1946. Further
                                    improvements were ministrated such as the erection of the college library building in 1947 and
                                    elementary school building in 1948. The College was also the first to offer a Research Course in
                                    Contemporary Philippine Literature in English in the Graduate Division in 1949. The College, too, was
                                    the first to teach Rizals Life and Works in Filipino.
                                    In 1953, Dr. Segundo M. Infantado, Sr. sat as the second president of the institution until 1962.
                                    To meet the demands of the changing times, the College offered the one-year General Clerical Course in
                                    1959.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                    Dr. Flora A. Ylagan succeded Dr. Infantado and became the third president of NTC from 1963 until 1969.
                                    It was during her term that the Administration Building was extended to accommodate its increasing
                                    number of enrollees.

                                    In 1969, Dr. Cresencio G, Peralta served as the fourth president of the institution. During this year, the
                                    Graduate Division was expanded to include the Doctor of Education (EdD) program which was granted
                                    government recognition in 1973.
                                    Being actively involved in community service or non-formal education since 1948, NTC was the first
                                    institution in the Philippine educational system that introduced a Parents-Teachers Association (PTA) in
                                    the tertiary level in 1972. It was also chosen as a Population Education Pilot School in Metro Manila in
                                    1974. In 1977, the one- year General Clerical Course was replaced by the two-year Junior Secretarial
                                    Course. In the same year a Community College for the Food Technician course was likewise opened.
                                    Through the years, the NTC has continually striven to keep abreast of educational developments here and
                                    abroad. It has always endeavoured to make its program of training relevant to the life of the nation, and
                                    the conditions prevailing among the people for whose welfare its students are being trained. Therefore,
                                    the increased emphasis on science and communication has impelled the College authorities to acquire an
                                    additional site where the Science Building was erected.
                                    Dr. Priscilla Y. Arguelles was elevated as the college president in 1987 and served the institution until 2016.
                                    Among private educational institutions in the Philippines, it attained in its own right, through years of
                                    performance, a pre-eminent place in educational leadership, particularly in the field of teacher education.
                                    The College was awarded a Plaque of Recognition on September 12, 1984, by the Department of
                                    Education, Culture, and Sports (DECS) for its invaluable service to the country as a private institution of
                                    learning and for ensuring a strong partnership in education between the government and the private
                                    sector.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    NTC saw an influx of students, thus further facilities improvements were seen. To enclose the entire building
                                    block for the security of the students, the Board of Trustees decided to put up two additional halls in place of
                                    the old college building. The latter was demolished to make way for the Ylagan Hall and the Infantado Hall.
                                    The Education Program of the College has been accredited and is classified under Level III as of July 10, 1987,
                                    by the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities- Commission on Accreditation (PACU-COA). Currently,
                                    the program is in the Level III reaccredited status.
                                    To give new meaning and significance to the preparation of kindergarten, elementary, secondary and college
                                    teachers, as well as administrators, supervisors and other specialists in education, a five-year course, Bachelor
                                    of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESED) was opened in 1988. Responding to the challenge of bringing
                                    technology into the classrooms, computer education enriched the General Education curriculum and a new
                                    major in Computer Education was added in the BSED. Computer laboratories for all levels were installed and
                                    faculty training in technology integration was initiated.

                                    PREPARING MANPOWER FOR THE INDUSTRY
                                    Gearing toward industrialization and developing professionals for national productivity and global
                                    competitiveness, clerical and secretarial courses have been enriched, revised and ladderized in 1992, leading
                                    to a four-year Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA) major in Computer Secretarial Education,
                                    which is now known as Bachelor of Science in Office Administration.
                                    In 1993, a ladderized four-year Hotel and Restaurant Management course was opened, which aimed at
                                    providing education and training for manpower that would meet the needs of the hospitality industry.
                                    The I.T. Building was erected in 2003 to house the computer laboratories to support the pursuit of the institution
                                    for its graduates to be attuned to the modern times.
                                    In 2004, the College started offering TESDA Programs. The two-year programs: Food Service Management
                                    (FSM), Computerized Office Management (COM) and Medical Office Assistantship (MOA) have been offered up
                                    to 2011. TESDA Programs, Bread and Pastry Production NC II and Food and Beverage Service NC II, two year
                                    Associate in Hotel and Restaurant Services, and Bartending NC II were offered until 2016.

                                    <br />
                                    The Bachelor of Library and Information Science (BLIS) replaced the Library Science major of BSE and BEED
                                    in 2007. This has paved the way to making the major a straight program.
                                    In 2009, Bachelor of Science in Tourism (BST), Bachelor of Science in Travel Management (BSTrM) and
                                    Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) were opened to meet the needs of the corporate
                                    world. It was also this year that the Rizal Building was inaugurated.
                                    To continue expanding the services of The National Teachers College and to meet the demands of the
                                    times, permit was granted for NTC to offer Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) and
                                    Bachelor of Science in Psychology in June 2011 and Bachelor of Science in Accountancy in 2012. In order

                                    to serve more students, a new four-story building was constructed in 2014 which featured 12 fully air-
